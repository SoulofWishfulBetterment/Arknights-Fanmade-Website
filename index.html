            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            <p><i><b>Arknights</b></i> (Chinese: 明日方舟; pinyin: <i>Míngrì Fāngzhōu</i>, "Tomorrow's Ark") is a free-to-play tatical 
            RPG/tower defense mobile game for IOS and Andriod featuring gacha game mechanics. Arknights (明日方舟) is developed by 
            the Chinese video game development company <abbr title="Hypergryph Network Technology Co. Ltd."><a href="https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Hypergryph#Games:~:text=Hypergryph%20Network%20Technology%20Co.%20Ltd.%20(Chinese%3A%20%E9%B9%B0%E8%A7%92%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C)%2C%20commonly%20known%20as%20Hypergryph%20(HG)%2C%20is%20a%20video%20game%20development%20company%20based%20in%20Shanghai%2C%20China.%20It%20is%20known%20as%20the%20creator%20and%20developer%20of%20Arknights%20and%20the%20publisher%20of%20the%20game%27s%20original%20Chinese%20version.">
            Hypergryph (鹰角网络)</a></abbr> and was released in mainland China on 1 May 2019. Later, the game would be released in 
            Japan, Korea, North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia on the 15th and 16th of Janaury 2020 by Yostar

            <h4>About the World of Arknights (Taken from <a href="https://arknights.fandom.com/wiki/Terra#:~:text=The%20world%20of,the%20vast%20ocean.">Arknights Fandom Wiki</a>):</h4>
            <p>
                The world of Terra is similar, if not identical, to our Earth, including having an oxygen atmosphere, a more-or-less 
                identical gravity and atmospheric pressure, and carbon-based lifeforms; even humans from our world will have no issue 
                living on it if they are somehow brought into Terra. However, what sets Terra apart from our world is the Catastrophes 
                – cataclysmic natural disasters which force much of the Terrans to adopt a nomadic way of life through nomadic cities instead 
                of a sedentary one. A crystalline substance known as Originium is left behind at the site of Catastrophes and is widely used 
                as a source of energy and the catalyst for magic-like Originium Arts. But at the same time, it is capable of causing a terminal 
                disease known as Oripathy from direct or prolonged exposure which is responsible for much of Arknights' rather bleak tone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Terra is predominantly inhabited by various races known as the Ancients, an amalgamation of humanoids with animal features and completely 
                anthropomorphic animals. Other than the Ancients, Terra is also inhabited by Elders who are the previous ruling class of Terra. 
                The Terran races have an extraordinary strength that could easily outmatch our world's humans thanks to their unique racial traits. 
                Each race also has a different anatomy that requires extensive medical studies to fully comprehend. Aside from the Ancients and 
                Elders, there are god-like beings known as Feranmuts like those who once ruled over Yan, eldritch demons inhabiting the northern 
                tundra and southern desert, and the Seaborn from the abyss of the vast ocean.

            <h4>General Gameplay (Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights#:~:text=The%20core%20gameplay,and%20replicates%20them.">Wikipedia</a>):</h4>            
            <p>The core gameplay is that of a tower defense game, with a number of characters ("operators") as towers. Melee 
            operators can be placed on ground tiles and ranged operators on elevated tiles. Melee operators physically block 
            enemies from advancing, and ranged operators deal ranged damage, heal or otherwise support melee operators. Players 
            must place operators on the correct tiles to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the player's base. Once in place, an 
            operator's skills can be activated after a time for special effects, or they can be withdrawn for redeployment after a 
            delay.
            </p>
            
            <p>Because there is often a limited number of viable solutions, especially at high difficulties, Arknights has also been
            described as a puzzle game. The gameplay does not require quick reaction times (the game is pauseable, and time slows 
            down while commands are issued), but rather on-the-spot tactical analysis and foresight.
            </p>

            <p>As the player progresses through the game, they unlock more stages, operators and resources, and are also introduced 
            to new types of enemies and gameplay mechanics. Levels that have been cleared with a three-star rating can be 
            auto-completed without player input, as the game records the player's actions and replicates them.
